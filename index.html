        <h3 id="lesson-text2">This is all about HTML and how to use it. Here is the simple skeleton you need to learn to start doing HTML. So, first you add the Doctype HTML tag like this. "<!DOCTYPE html>". Then you write the html tag like this "<html>" and close it "</html>". Then, Inside the HTML tag, add the "<head>" tag. Inside write the title, which is what will show up on the tab when you open your website. Do it like this "<title>Example title</title>", and create the "<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">" tag to link CSS, which you will learn later. Then, do the script tag like this: "<script src="main.js"></script>" tag to add JS. We have a tutorial for that, but first you must learn this. Then, inside of the Html tag and outside of the head, create the body, where you will design he webpage like this "<body>". That is it! You have successfully learned how to create a HTML skeleton. <a href="https://educational-websites.github.io/Live-Code-Editor/" target="_blank">Try it yourself</a>
